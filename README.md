### Dashboard

Upon logging in, users are greeted with two feeds: "Outreach" and "Applications." Initially, these feeds will be empty for new users, but they will provide helpful messages to assist them in getting started.

### Navigation Bar

The Navigation bar offers users two choices: they can either select 'Info' to access more details about the application or navigate to their Template list. Additionally, the option to log out is available in the navbar.

### Template List

New users start with the 'Outreach Example' template, and they can easily create new templates. Any additional templates they create will appear in this list.
